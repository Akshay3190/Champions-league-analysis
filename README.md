Description About the Dataset & Contents-
<br>
<br>
The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a group and knockout format. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.
Data includes statistics starting with the beginning of the Champions League (1992/93) season & up to the group stage of the 2021/22 season.
This time I’ve used both the Radial bar chart and butterfly chart to get the visualisation in a specific manner.
<br>
<br>
Let’s talk about both charts separately.
<br>
<br>
Radial bar Chart-
<br>
<br>
A radial bar chart is a variation of the bar chart. It takes quite an unusual approach to value representation. Radial charts can be used to display data that you would display in a bar chart. While bar charts are easier to understand at first glance, radial charts are more eye-catching and will display the same information in a more aesthetically pleasing manner. In some places, they call it a multi-layered doughnut chart because of its layout. It uses a polar coordinate system, rather than a cartesian one to represent values. The values represented are by angle rather than by length. The Radial bar chart allows you to use it to present percentages, totals, counts, and many other things, provided you can find a reasonable way to group the contents of the x-axis, whether by category or by time.

<br>
Butterfly chart-
<br>
<br>
A butterfly chart, also called a tornado plot/graph, is a special type of bar chart in which the data categories are placed vertically along the y–axis instead of the traditional horizontal / x-axis. For better understanding, the categories can be arranged in an ordered manner with the largest bar at the top and the smallest one at the bottom.
<br>
By using the butterfly chart, I’ve compared two different parameters under a single category. It is also easy to visualize two separate quantities at the same time and the process of comparing also becomes simpler.
<br>
One drawback of this chart could be that the values on both sides should be comparable otherwise it might create a heavily one-sided chart.
<br>
Butterfly charts are widely used to compare before and after parameters.

Insights of Analysis-
<br>
<br>
1-In the map visual we’ve got the countries details that won titles maximum times. Spain won it 19 times followed by the UK  14 & Italy 12 times.
<br>
<br>
2-Horizontal bar charts-
<br>
A-Real Madrid CF won the titles 14 times. AC Milan secured the 2nd position by winning the title 7 times.
<br>
B-During the 2 decades Ronaldo topped the position by scoring an outstanding 154 goals.
<br>
Lionel Messi got 2nd spot by scoring 125 goals.
<br>
<br>
3-Radial bar charts-
<br>
I’ve created 2 radial bar charts that nicely represent the appearances of both top 10 players & coaches for the entire 2 decades. In details & tooltips, I’ve mentioned the player’s name, the coach's name & their respective appearances to get the idea while hovering.
<br>
<br>
4-Butterfly Charts-
<br>
A-For visual Top clubs played by games I’ve compared two parameters win & loss. In 2nd visual for Top clubs scored by goals comparison is shown between clubs that scored goals both for & against.
<br>
B-To get the respective top categories I’ve set the criteria. For Win & loss clubs must have played at least 200 matches. For goals comparison, I’ve set a limit of 300 goals including goals against & for.
<br>
C-Tooltips showing the exact idea about both the goals scored ( against, for & difference ) & Number of matches played ( along with win, loss & draw status ).
<br>
<br>
The entire visualization gives us a better idea about the UEFA Champions League’s match analysis.
